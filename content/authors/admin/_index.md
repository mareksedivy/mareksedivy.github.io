I am a postdoc in the [CORPTAX](https://centreforpublicfinance.eu/) research group. In my research, I focus on inequality, household economics, and public economics.  I currently work on projects that study the long-run evolution of consumption inequality between and within households, regional price levels, and corporate tax avoidance. 

I have obtained my Ph.D. from the [Institute of Economic Studies, Charles University](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/en).
