  We study the evolution of consumption inequality in an economy transitioning from a centrally planned economy to a capitalist system. Our findings suggest that consumption inequality did not track income inequality during the transition period, thus supporting the currently available evidence on the joint evolution of income and consumption inequality. We further find that the economic transition constituted a transitory rather than a permanent shock. Moreover, this shock disproportionately affected households with older household heads.
