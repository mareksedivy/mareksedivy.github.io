  Unequal consumption sharing within households is well-documented. However, there is limited evidence on the stability of within-household inequality over time. We combine a collective household model with consumption survey data spanning 24 years to study the evolution of within-household consumption inequality. Our findings reveal substantial and persistent within-household consumption inequality. On average, Czech men consume nearly 60% of total adult household consumption expenditure during the considered time period.
