I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Economic Studies, Charles University](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz/en). I focus on inequality, household economics, and public economics. I currently work on projects that study the long-run evolution of consumption inequality between and within households.

I am also part of the [CORPTAX](https://corptax.cuni.cz/) research group, in which I contribute to research on the effects of corporate tax avoidance on inequality, and the [Public Finance Center](https://centrumverejnychfinanci.cz/), in which I contribute to the analysis of the VAT.
